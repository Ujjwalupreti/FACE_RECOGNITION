# FACE_RECOGNITION

Face recognition is a computer vision task that involves identifying or verifying individuals based on their facial features. Using Python, developers can implement this task by leveraging libraries such as OpenCV, Dlib, or face_recognition, which provide pre-trained models for facial detection and recognition. The process typically involves detecting faces in images or video streams, extracting unique facial features (such as landmarks, contours, or embeddings), and comparing them to known faces stored in a database. Machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to improve accuracy. Additionally, face recognition has applications in security, access control, and user authentication systems.
